## INTERESTS and SKILLS

+ I am particular interested in compiler techniques and have spent a lot of time over it when I was in year one. The following are some of my works :
  1. A regular expression engine using automata technic : [ReEngine](https://github.com/nzhl/ReEngine).
  2. A C compiler which can compile a subset of standard c language : [ncc](https://github.com/nzhl/ncc).


+ My current work focus is data mining and machine learning which include but not limited to :

  + web-crawler to crawl information from internet, I am really familar with the famous python crawler framework :[scrapy](https://scrapy.org).
  + extract information from html trees, I translated part of the open source html tree parsing library [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) official document into Chinese : [Beautifulsoup in Chinese](http://www.cnblogs.com/nzhl/p/5593277.html)
  + Completed the coursera online machine learning course: (Machine Learning)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning]
  + Completed the famous introduction book [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html).
   + A project to predict house price in UK in a machine learning way. 	

+ I like reading and writing, I have read a lot of books about computer science during my last two years which include but not limited to :

  + C++ primer, thinking in java, Introduction to Algorithm, Computer Systems : A Programmer’s perspective, Machine Learning, head first to jsp
  + Sometimes write person blogs to record my feeling after reading or doing some projects.
    + Blog In China : [内脏坏了](http://www.cnblogs.com/nzhl/)
    + Blog In UK : [Nzhl Blog](https://github.com/nzhl/blog)
